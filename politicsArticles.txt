(cnn)
it
has
been
more
than
two
months
since
kamala
harris
was
sworn
in
as
vice
president
of
the
united
states,
a
historic
moment
for
the
country
,
as
harris
is
the
first
woman
and
the
first
woman
of
color
to
hold
the
second
highest
office
in
the
land.
yet,
harris
--
along
with
her
husband,
georgetown
law
professor
douglas
emhoff
--
is
still,
ostensibly,
living
out
of
suitcases,
unable
to
move
into
the
private
residence
reserved
for
the
vice
president
because
it's
still
undergoing
renovations.
it's
unclear
why
the
renovations
are
taking
so
long,
said
one
administration
official,
but
it's
a
situation
that
has
left
harris
increasingly
and
understandably
bothered,
according
to
several
people
who
spoke
to
cnn
about
her
situation.
"she
is
getting
frustrated,"
said
another
administration
official,
noting
with
each
passing
day
the
desire
to
move
in
to
her
designated
house
--
a
stately,
turreted
mansion
two-and-a-half
miles
from
the
white
house
--
grows
more
intense.
the
second
couple
continues
to
live
in
temporary
housing
at
blair
house,
the
president's
official
guest
quarters,
just
across
pennsylvania
avenue
from
the
white
house.
the
administration
has
provided
no
official
explanation
for
the
delay,
and
a
spokesperson
for
harris
did
not
respond
to
cnn's
request
for
comment.
cnn
has
looked
at
various
government
contracts,
awarded
for
myriad
issues
at
the
vice
president's
residence
over
the
last
few
years,
many
of
which
detail
intensive
foundational
work.
from
recently
wrapped
projects
on
a
retention
pond
to
a
replaced
tank
system
for
$164,000
from
last
september,
repairs
and
upkeep
appear
constant.
there's
also
an
ongoing
$3.8
million
contract
for
"plumbing,
heating
and
air-conditioning
contractors,"
according
to
the
contract
on
the
united
states
government
spending
website.
the
contracts,
while
substantial,
aren't
overtly
egregious
in
terms
of
cost
and
expectation,
considering
the
home
is
9,000-plus
square
feet
and
was
built
in
1893.
tax
records
from
2018
indicate
$119,000
in
expenses
were
used
to
provide
updates
and
improvements
in
and
around
the
grounds
of
the
residence,
for
example.
however,
the
current
contracts
do
not
address
specifically
why
the
vice
president
is
still
not
living
there,
which
is
leading
to
growing
questions
--
and
agitation
--
about
the
pace
of
the
work.
harris
has
recently
been
spotted
at
her
future
home,
popping
in
for
an
hour-long
visit
three
weeks
ago,
per
cnn.
two
administration
staff
with
knowledge
of
the
ongoing
updates
told
cnn
that
harris
--
who
likes
to
cook
--
requested
work
be
done
on
the
kitchen.
the
vice
president's
residence
at
the
naval
observatory,
as
seen
in
2015,
is
two-and-half
miles
from
the
white
house.
it
is
not
unusual
for
there
to
be
at
least
a
couple
of
weeks
between
residents,
so
the
naval
staff
who
operate
the
home
can
refresh,
said
elizabeth
haenle,
who
served
as
vice
president
residence
manager
and
social
secretary
for
former
vice
president
dick
cheney.
"from
time
to
time,
the
navy
will
ask
the
vice
president
and
their
respective
families
to
delay
moving
in
so
that
they
have
time
for
maintenance
and
upgrades
that
are
not
easy
to
perform
once
the
vice
president
takes
up
residence,"
haenle
said.
shortly
after
inauguration,
a
harris
aide
told
cnn
the
vice
president
wouldn't
be
immediately
moving
in,
citing
the
need
for
some
repairs
to
the
home
"that
are
more
easily
conducted
with
the
home
unoccupied."
a
move-in
date
was
still
to
be
determined
at
the
time.
another
administration
official
told
cnn
some
of
the
work
included
renovating
the
home's
chimneys
--
there
are
seven
working
fireplaces
--
as
well
as
other
updates.
lacking
the
comforts
of
home
although
blair
house
provides
comfortable,
even
luxurious,
accommodations,
harris
and
emhoff's
current
surroundings
lack
the
creature
comforts
of
a
home.
antiques
and
museum-quality
pieces
of
american
history
deck
each
of
the
100-plus
rooms,
which
include
a
gym
and
a
private
hair
salon.
and
although
the
professional,
full-time
staff
of
more
than
a
dozen
provide
amenities
as
accommodating
as
a
luxury
hotel,
blair
house
does
not
offer
the
laid-back
vibe
harris
and
emhoff
are
said
to
prefer
when
they
are
home.
the
couple
enjoy
a
more
casual,
west
coast
informality,
with
frequent
visits
from
family
and
large
sunday
suppers,
the
former
california
senator
has
said.
the
main
bedroom
suite
at
blair
house
was
redecorated
by
celebrity
interior
designer
thomas
pheasant,
brought
on
in
2012
to
make
updates
to
overall
décor,
and
includes
a
massive,
canopied
bed
draped
in
luxe
fabrics
and
furnishings
that
are
more
reminiscent
of
mount
vernon
than
a
california
modern
mood.
her
condo
in
washington,
dc,
which
she
moved
out
of
to
live
at
blair
house,
was
inside
a
sleek,
eco-chic,
minimalist
building
in
the
city's
west
end
neighborhood.
blair
house
is
known
for
its
luxurious
accommodations.
when
the
second
couple
does
finally
move
into
one
observatory
circle,
where
the
vice
president's
residence
is
located
on
the
grounds
of
the
naval
observatory,
they
will
find
a
home
quite
unlike
their
city
condo
or
blair
house,
but
also
very
different
from
the
white
house.
there
are
far
fewer
formalities,
fewer
staff
and
more
freedom.
"the
white
house
is
office
and
home
to
the
president
so
there
is
that
feeling
of
living
above
the
'shop'
at
the
white
house,"
said
haenle.
"for
the
vice
president
and
his
or
her
family,
the
vice
president's
residence
--
or
vpr
--
is
calm
in
the
midst
of
a
stormy
washington,
both
politically
and
logistically.
at
the
end
of
the
day,
the
vice
president
can
travel
a
short
distance
northwest
and
find
respite
in
a
country-like
setting."
deer
often
roam
the
property,
though
in
reality
it
is
a
stone's
throw
from
dc's
downtown
office
buildings
and
city
traffic.
'you're
gonna
love
the
pool'
the
dozens
of
acres
that
make
up
the
grounds
of
the
naval
observatory
offer
privacy
and
the
ability
to
move
about
with
more
leisure
than
can
the
president
and
first
lady
at
the
white
house.
biden
last
month
at
a
cnn
town
hall
referred
to
the
white
house
as
a
"gilded
cage,"
and
lamented
not
having
the
same
accoutrements
at
his
disposal
as
when
he
lived
at
the
vice
president's
residence
for
eight
years.
"you're
on
80
acres,
overlooking
the
rest
of
the
city,"
said
biden.
"you
can
walk
out,
and
there's
a
swimming
pool.
...
you
can
ride
a
bicycle
around
and
never
leave
the
property,
and
work
out
--
but
the
white
house
is
very
different."
(the
vice
president's
mansion
actually
sits
on
13-gated
acres
of
the
land,
not
80
--
the
entire
naval
observatory
compound,
with
several
separate
buildings
and
offices
unrelated
to
the
residence,
is
72
acres.)
the
quayle
family
had
the
pool
installed
when
they
lived
at
the
vice
president's
residence.
it
was
former
vice
president
dan
quayle
who
had
the
heated
pool
installed,
and
it
became
biden's
treasured
refuge.
while
vice
president,
biden
would
throw
raucous
summer
pool
parties
for
staff
and
their
families,
bringing
out
water
cannons
and
partaking
in
drenching
shoot-outs
with
the
children
who
attended.
in
2017,
shortly
after
moving
in,
then-second
lady
karen
pence
shared
in
an
interview
biden's
parting
words
to
her
just
after
her
husband,
mike
pence,
was
sworn
in:
"that's
the
thing
that
joe
biden
said
to
us
as
he
got
into
the
limo
and
left
the
capitol
on
inauguration
day
—
he
said,
'you're
gonna
love
the
pool.'"
harris,
who
early
in
her
vice
presidency
was
spotted
running
up
and
down
the
steps
at
the
lincoln
memorial
for
her
workout,
secret
service
agents
nearby,
will
have
the
outdoor
space
to
jog,
swim
and
workout
at
her
new
home
--
without
the
public
spotting
her
and
posting
videos
on
social
media.
harris
has
said
she
works
out
every
morning,
and
swimming
can
sometimes
be
a
part
of
her
routine
--
another
reason
the
vice
presidential
pool
is
a
perk.
a
vice
president
who
likes
to
cook
should
she
wish
to
add
her
personal
signature
to
the
residence
or
its
grounds
--
such
as
quayle
did
with
the
pool
or
george
h.w.
bush
did
with
an
outdoor
horseshoe
pit
or
the
bidens
did
with
a
garden
where
the
names
of
all
the
home's
occupants,
pets
included,
are
engraved
--
updates
and
tweaks
can
circumvent
the
elaborate
process
of
approvals
that
any
changes
at
the
white
house
must
go
through.
when
she
was
second
lady,
jill
biden
helped
create
the
family
heritage
garden
of
the
vice
president,
where
all
occupants
and
their
family
members
--
including
pets
--
are
memorialized
on
the
stone
pavers
around
a
fountain
as
seen
here
2016.
however,
as
with
the
white
house,
a
separate
foundation
has
been
established
to
cover
most
updates
with
government-provided
funds.
also
like
the
white
house,
the
vice
president
has
at
her
disposal
roomfuls
of
historic
furnishings
and
decorative
arts
from
which
to
choose
from
as
part
of
a
private
collection
reserved
for
the
president
and
vice
president
to
make
their
temporary
homes
feel
homey
and
to
their
personal
tastes.
karen
pence
once
said
she
left
the
residence
rooms
set
up
in
much
the
same
way
as
the
biden's
had
it
before
them,
since
the
pences
liked
the
layout
and
saw
no
reason
to
upend
it.
"it
is
a
home
with
a
lot
of
history
and
character,
but
over
the
years
the
navy
has
kept
it
well-maintained
and
upgraded
it,"
haenle
said.
"during
my
time
with
the
cheney's,
we
logged
the
inventory
of
the
house
and
restored
furnishings
and
art
going
back
to
the
rockefellers
and
mondale's."
harris
is
known
to
derive
satisfaction
from
cooking,
and
she's
no
doubt
hungering
for
the
personal
space
to
do
that.
she
once
said
in
an
interview
with
new
york
magazine's
"the
cut,"
"if
i'm
cooking,
i
feel
like
i'm
in
control
of
my
life."
harris
and
emhoff
are
fond
of
their
nights
in,
and
enjoy
sharing
time
in
the
kitchen
and
good
food.
the
couple,
separately
and
together,
are
frequent
patrons
of
stachowski's
market,
a
butcher
shop
and
mini-gourmet
provisions
store
located
on
a
quaint
corner
in
georgetown.
for
at-home
entertaining,
the
residence
offers
"a
wrap-around
veranda
that
faces
away
from
the
busy
streets
of
northwest
washington,"
notes
haenle.
"it
is
a
special
place
and
makes
for
great
sunday
afternoon
family
gatherings,"
while
still
being
formal
enough
to
welcome
heads
of
state.
last
may,
harris
told
glamour
magazine
she
was
getting
emhoff
more
involved
in
cooking;
her
schedule
can
no
longer
handle
the
hands-on
approach
she
likes
to
take
in
the
kitchen.
"it
takes
him
about
four
hours
to
do
what
i
do
in
an
hour,
but
it
is
delicious
so
i
just
have
to
be
quiet
and
let
it
happen,"
she
said.
but
it's
the
meditative
and
relaxing
quality
of
cooking
up
family
meals
that
harris
has
cited
in
multiple
interviews
as
therapeutic,
and
it's
something
she's
still
waiting
to
do
in
her
official
residence.
washington
—
he
reflected
on
his
reputation
as
a
“nice
guy”
and
a
“decent
man.”
he
talked
about
how
his
great-grandfather
set
sail
on
the
irish
sea
to
make
the
difficult
journey
to
america.
he
observed
that
“politics
is
the
art
of
the
possible.”
in
his
first
formal
news
conference
since
taking
office,
president
biden
offered
an
early
glimpse
of
the
man
who
inhabits
the
oval
office
and
how
he
is
approaching
the
presidency
so
far.
unlike
president
donald
j.
trump’s
hot-tempered
blowups
or
president
barack
obama’s
extended
answers
of
professorial
cool,
mr.
biden
was
the
sober
political
veteran
comfortable
with
thinking
out
loud,
talking
personally
and
conversationally,
and
showing
occasional
impatience
before
a
roomful
of
reporters.
when
he
received
a
question
he
did
not
like,
such
as
whether
he
expected
to
run
in
2024
against
mr.
trump,
he
shrugged
it
off
with,
“i
don’t
know
where
you
guys
come
from,
man.”
but
mr.
biden
did
say
he
expected
to
run
again,
with
vice
president
kamala
harris
at
his
side.
after
nearly
four
decades
in
politics,
including
eight
years
as
vice
president,
he
showed
himself
as
a
student
of
the
office.
“it’s
a
matter
of
timing,”
he
said
when
asked
about
his
legislative
priorities.
“as
you’ve
all
observed,
the
successful
presidents
better
than
me
have
been
successful
in
large
part
because
they
know
how
to
time
what
they’re
doing.
order
it.
decide
priorities.
what
needs
to
be
done.”
to
that
end,
he
cited
his
$3
trillion
infrastructure
bill
as
“the
next
major
initiative.”
former

fire
almost
every

describing

to
rinse

but
a
number
of
former
officials
expressed
surprise
at
how
most
of
the
council
was
fired.
"while
i
respect
the
right
for
a

to
alter
the
hsac
to
address
their
needs,
dismissing
the
entire

outright
and
stopping
a
lot
of
important
work
(that
was
underway)
is
not
the
right
approach,"
former
dhs
secretary
chad
wolf
said
in
a
tweet.
ken
cuccinelli,
who
served
on
the
council
after
having
served
as
acting
deputy
dhs
secretary
and
acting
head
of
u.s.
citizenship
and
immigration
services,
was
stronger
in
his
criticism,
calling
the
move
"a
mass
firing,
a
good
old
fashioned
purge."
cuccinelli
said
that
he
believed
it
was
in
line
with
the
new
administration’s
moves
to
suppress
information
related
to
homeland
security
and
the
border
in
particular
--
a
nod
to
criticisms
from
republicans
and
journalists
that
the
administration
has
locked
out
media
outlets
from
border
facilities
amid
a
continuing
border
crisis.
"it’s
a
sign
they
simply
won’t
brook
any
dissent.
it’s
consistent
with
other
things
they’re
doing
like
supporting
h.r.1
which
has
free
speech
limitations,
it’s
consistent
with
them
not
letting
media
into
border
facilities,"
he
said.
"this
is
a
part
of
a
broader
pattern
and
practice
by
biden’s
administration
of
being
the
most
stalinistic
in
my
adult
lifetime."
he
also
said
the
council
had
a
number
of
meaningful
projects
underway
that
had
now
just
been
wiped
out.
"the
hsac
did
analysis,
did
studies
of
it
own,
and
part
of
the
value
was
that
it
wasn’t
tied
so
closely
to
the
then-current
administration
and
we
used
that
and
there
were
people
on
there
who
weren't
politically
aligned
with
president
trump
--
but
our
secretaries
did
not
fire
them
for
that,"
he
said.

in
the
middle
of
a
border
crisis,
he
wasn’t
surprised
at
his
own
removal
due
to
the
administration’s
stance
on
immigration
enforcement,
of
which
he
has
been
a
strong
critic.
"i’ve
been
enforcing
immigration
laws
since
1984
and
this
administration
has
clearly
shown
it
has
no
intention
of
enforcing
our
laws
because
they
decapitated
ice,
border
patrol
agents
are
turning
into
welcome
agents
so
my
role
on
hsac
would
be
null
because
im
an
enforcement
guy,"
he
said.
"i’m
surprised
it
took
this
long
to
take
me
off
because
i'm
out
there
telling
the
american
people
the
truth
and
i’m
sure
that’s
upsetting
a
lot
of
people,"
he
said.
"but
yeah
i'm
surprised
that
in
the
middle
of
this
crisis
that
you
get
rid
of
the
whole
hsac,
because
hsac
is
supposed
to
be
bringing
different
ideas
from
all
sides,
left
and
the
right
and
thinking
out
the
box
and
i'm
surprised
because
the
administration
needs
all
the
help
it
can
get
right
now."

they're
